The problem statement was separating hard skills from other types of data. 
Now we were given two datasets raw_skills and example_hard_skills.
raw_skills had a mixture of both hard skills and other data whereas example_hard_skills consisted of only hard skills.

After doing few EDA and observations, I found out that skills other than hard skills comprised mostly data from a CV/resume. So I decided to gather some CV/resume data and did unigrams and bigrams on this.

Basically I converted this into a binary classification problem where one class was the example_hard_skills and the other was CV/resume generated data.

After that I encoded everything using average Word2Vec. I used spacy library for this and used small vectors which were of 97 dimensions.

After generating the data, I trained a simple SGDClassifier with log loss as loss function. This gave me a very good f1 score of 0.91.
